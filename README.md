IAT-167 Final Project

This game contains sprites that were made by me but are based on Red ball 4 (Volume 1 & 2). The music is extracted from 
Red Ball 4 Volume 2 and some level designs were inspired from Red ball 1.

This Game was used as an assignment submission in a university course and is just for educational purposes.

To play the game, just download and run [Final_Project.jar](https://github.com/manshantsingh/IAT167_FinalProject/raw/master/Final_Project.jar) file.
